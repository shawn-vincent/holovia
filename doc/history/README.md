# History Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains **nonnormative throwaway documents** that capture point-in-time thoughts, drafts, and scratch work. These files are **not authoritative** and should not be considered part of the official project documentation.

## File Naming Convention

All files in this directory must follow the strict naming pattern:

```
yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-name-of-file.md
```

**Examples:**
- `2025-09-09-14-30-initial-brainstorm.md`
- `2025-09-09-16-45-api-design-thoughts.md`
- `2025-09-10-09-15-user-flow-draft.md`

## Rules

1. **Always check system date/time** when creating files - use `date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M"` command
2. **Throwaway nature** - these documents may be deleted, moved, or ignored at any time
3. **No dependencies** - official documentation should never reference these files
4. **Point-in-time snapshots** - capture ideas as they exist at creation time
5. **Markdown format** - all files should use `.md` extension

## Usage

- Brainstorming sessions
- Draft requirements before official versions
- Meeting notes and discussion captures
- Experimental design ideas
- Temporary analysis or research notes
- Work-in-progress documentation

## Important Note

**These files are not authoritative.** For official project requirements, specifications, and documentation, refer to the main `doc/requirements/` directory and other formal documentation locations.
