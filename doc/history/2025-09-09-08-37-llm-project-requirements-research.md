# Research: Requirements for One-Shot LLM Project Generation (September 2025)

**Research Date:** September 9, 2025  
**Purpose:** Investigate best practices for writing requirements specifications for one-shot LLM project generation based on current 2025 state-of-the-art

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research, successful one-shot LLM project generation in 2025 requires structured requirements that emphasize context, specificity, iterative refinement capabilities, and robust testing frameworks. The field has matured significantly with proven methodologies for going from requirements to complete working projects.

## Key Findings

### 1. Requirements Quality is Critical

**Primary Finding:** LLMs need detailed requirements as input. The potential of LLMs to generate effective code hinges on the details and clarity of the requirements documents. Well-crafted requirements are not just a necessity but a catalyst in fully harnessing the capabilities of LLMs.

**Time Savings:** Research demonstrates 7-47x time savings compared to human-created documents (4-24 hours human vs. minutes for LLM with proper requirements).

### 2. Context-First Approach

**Common Mistake:** Jumping straight to requesting specific functions without establishing broader context.

**Best Practice:** Always establish:
- Project environment and constraints
- Existing patterns to follow
- Architecture context
- Integration requirements
- Tech stack and dependencies

### 3. Progressive Prompting Method

**Recommended Approach:** Stepwise engagement where LLMs incrementally tackle development tasks:
1. Interpret provided requirements
2. Extract functional requirements
3. Create object-oriented models
4. Generate implementation
5. Create test cases

### 4. Current Leading Models (2025)

**Top Performers:**
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Most advanced for coding in 2025
- **GPT-4.5 & Claude:** Excel in complex reasoning
- **DeepSeek V3:** 671B parameters, strong in code generation and mathematics
- **Code Llama 70B:** Best open-source option, trained on 1T tokens of code

## Requirements Specification Framework for 2025

### A. Project Definition Requirements

```markdown
## 1. Business Context
- Problem statement in business terms
- Success criteria (SMART framework)
- User value proposition
- Performance expectations and SLAs

## 2. Technical Context
- Target platform and deployment (e.g., Vercel, AWS)
- Technology stack constraints
- Integration requirements
- Existing codebase patterns to follow

## 3. Functional Requirements
- Core user stories with acceptance criteria
- API specifications and data models
- User interface requirements
- Workflow and business logic

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Security considerations
- Scalability requirements
- Accessibility standards
```

### B. LLM-Specific Requirements Structure

**Context Provision:**
- Include relevant existing code samples
- Specify coding patterns and conventions
- Define error handling approaches
- Document testing frameworks in use

**Iterative Refinement Support:**
- Expect multiple rounds of refinement
- Structure requirements for progressive elaboration
- Include feedback mechanisms
- Plan for edge case discovery

### C. Quality Assurance Framework

**Testing Requirements:**
- Automated testing integration
- Code quality standards (linting, formatting)
- Security scanning requirements
- Performance testing criteria

**Human Oversight Points:**
- Code review checkpoints
- Architecture validation
- Security audit requirements
- Performance optimization review

### D. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Insufficient Context:** Not providing enough project background
2. **Vague Success Criteria:** Unmeasurable or unclear goals
3. **Missing Integration Details:** How code fits into existing systems
4. **Ignoring Performance:** Not specifying efficiency requirements
5. **Security Blind Spots:** Missing security considerations
6. **One-Shot Expectations:** Not planning for iterative refinement

## 2025-Specific Considerations

### Advanced Techniques Available
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** For external knowledge integration
- **Fine-tuning:** LoRA and QLoRA for specialized requirements
- **Model Quantization:** For efficient deployment
- **Multi-modal Integration:** Code + visual requirements

### Integration Patterns
- **LangChain/LlamaIndex:** For complex workflows
- **OpenRouter:** For model flexibility
- **Vector Databases:** For context management
- **Function Calling:** For tool integration

### Responsible AI Requirements
- Bias detection and mitigation strategies
- Transparent AI decision documentation
- User consent and control mechanisms
- Audit trails for AI-generated decisions

## Recommendations for Holovia Phase 0
